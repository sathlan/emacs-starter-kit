* Starter kit Anything

** Installation
The prefix key is =<f5> a= by default which causes problem, so I use
=M-n=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (concat dotfiles-dir "src/anything-config"))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (concat dotfiles-dir "src/anything-config/extensions"))
  (setq anything-command-map-prefix-key "M-n")
  (require 'anything-startup)
#+end_src

Now type =M-n C-h= for a list of action that you can be done.
