* Starter kit Stylish
Check this from [[https://github.com/jrockway/stylish][jrockway's stylish at master - GitHub]] and the doc
there: [[http://blog.jrock.us/posts/Stylish%20REPL.pod][Stylish Pod]].  I conveniently copy it here:

I've been writing a bit of common lisp these days, and a "feature" I
really like is SLIME.  Rather than giving up Perl forever and telling
everyone how awesome lisp is, I decided it would be easier to just
steal the nice features for Perl instead.  After all, there aren't
very many "lisp mongers" groups :P

So, I've started a project called Stylish that is an
editor-independent editor<->Perl integration server.  You can browse
the source code at
L<http://git.jrock.us/?p=Server-Stylish.git;a=summary>, or download it
with C<< git clone git://git.jrock.us/Server-Stylish >>.

Here's how Stylish works.  Basically, your editor sends it a request,
it does something smart, and then it sends back the response.  Right
now, I've implemented a PPI-based syntax highlighter and a
Devel::REPL-based REPL (yes, it does plugins!).  Eventually I want to
add a debugger and documentation "browser" (basically like SLIME).

If you're using emacs, you can try the REPL right now.  It's "beta",
but I use it for everything now, so it's pretty solid and featureful.
To run it, get the source code, and inside emacs, run C<M-x
load-library> on C<emacs/stylish.el> (the networking code),
C<emacs/stylish-repl.el> (the REPL core), and
C<emacs/stylish-repl-iedit.el> (the interactive REPL-based editor).
Then, start the perl server by running C<perl -Ilib bin/stylish.pl>.
Finally, fire up the emacs REPL by running C<M-x stylish-repl> inside
emacs.  There's your REPL; it works like you think it would.  Enter
sends the line to Perl, and your result is printed (you also get stdin
and stdout).  M-n and M-p navigate the history.  C<,help> will show
you some help.  (BTW, this command system is extensible; read
stylish-repl-iedit.el for an example.)

It's hard to explain all the cool features here, so I made a
screencast:

I like it.  Hopefully you will too.  I'm looking forward to seeing the
TextMate and Vim integration layers. :)
